                           <h3>
                            Happy Tails Shelter receives animals from individuals who are no longer able to care for their pets and from other shelters that lack placement resources 
                            in their area. We also provide adoption services to animals that are lost, brought in as strays, abandoned, or seized in humane investigation cases.
                           </h3>
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <h2 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">Do the pets in the adoption center have a time limit?</h2> 
                           <h3>
                            There is no time limit for how long an animal stays in our adoption centers. On average, most cats are in new homes within 14 days from intake to adoption. 
                            For dogs, it’s about 10 days. If an animal is waiting longer than usual to find a new home, we might move that animal to another shelter so it can be 
                            seen by more people.
                           </h3>

                            <h2 style="color: blue;text-align: center;">How do I meet an animal I’m interested in adopting?</h2> 
                           <h3>
                            You’re welcome to visit the shelter anytime during adoption business hours to meet an animal you’re interested in adopting. Once at the shelter, staff and 
                            volunteers are available to assist you. Each of our three adoption centers have private visitation rooms where you and the pet can get acquainted.

                        <h2 style="color: blue;text-align: center;">Do I need to fill out an adoption application?</h2> 
                       <h3>
                        We use an interview process to ensure that each animal adopted will be matched with a compatible new owner. 
                        There is no application form to complete before you visit.
                       </h3>

                        <h2 style="color: blue; text-align: center;">How long will the adoption process take?</h2> 
                       <h3>
                        Plan to allow up to two hours to complete the adoption process. It may take longer depending on how many pets you wish to meet, your previous experience with pet 
                        care, and the number of other visitors at the shelter. Peak days for visitor traffic are Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, so please allow extra time if you plan to 
                        visit on those days.

                        Adoptions can be processed up to 30 minutes before closing time. If you wish to adopt an animals and it’s less than 30 minutes before closing, we can place the pet 
                        on hold for a fee for 24 hours to allow you to finish your visitation and/or finalize the adoption the following day.
