                            Tinky is a true companion who would love a family to give his devotion to.  
                            He was raised from kittenhood to be the ruler of everything. Through an unfortunate set of circumstances, 
                            his former kingdom is no more, and he is looking for a new home to love.

                            Biscuit is super sweet and very mellow.  
                            He was rescued with her Sister Dorothy.  
                            He needs a quiet home as he can be shy at first.   
                            He is very light and small and won't grow much bigger.

                            Dorothy is all about play. This confident lady loves her treats but especially loves her toys. 
                            If you have a wand toy, mouse toy or balls, she will jump right in and play all day with her bro, Biscuit!

                        Curious Gunner is all about exploring, play and toys. As a matter of fact, if you have a cat tree around or a windowsill, 
                        you will be entertained by Gunner performing his favorite sport—jumping! That is not to say that he would ever turn down
                        a tasty bit of Churu, but if you have a wand toy, mouse toy or balls, 
                        he will jump right in and play all day!

                        Lily has flourished beautifully and is showing off her sweet, affectionate and fun side each passing day! 
                        She is a sweet, friendly, and independent girl who spends her day following people from room to room.

                       <h3>
                        Nelli is true to herself. She’s a lover of all things treats (Churu is her favorite), 
                        chasing after wand toys and long naps in sunbeams and boxes (and maybe tubs, who knows).
                         One could say she’s the Pawtonic Ideal of a cat.

                       <h3>
                        Nester is the kind of cat that prefers to sit out on the action and binge a marathon of his favorite show. 
                        He is looking for a nice quiet home with a patient adopter since it will take him some time to warm up. 
                        He may always be somewhat shy, but with lots of yummy treats and words of encouragement he will be sure to show you his best cat self!

                       <h3>
                        We asked Tom to describe himself and he said, “Bringer of warmth and smiles,” 
                        which is definitely accurate! Although our pal sometimes thinks highly of himself, 
                        he can be more of a shy guy who’s still learning that the world isn’t so scary. 
        
                       </h3>

                       <h3>
                        Amber is best described as the “queen of the house!” This sweet gal may be a little shy at first, 
                        but tasty treats and calm baby talk will warm her up faster than winter snow melting in the sun. 
                        She loves pets and head scratches, while also valuing some alone time, too.
