                            I’ll be a loving companion, but it may take me a little 
                            longer to acclimate to new people and new environments. 
                            A quieter, low-activity home would give me the opportunity to get used to new things at my own pace.

                            new family to join me in the fun.

                        I love to be busy, both physically and mentally. I'll enjoy seeing and doing things with my new family, and prefer an active household. 
                        Energetic dogs like me need a companion who can provide adequate mental stimulation and exercise, such as running, hiking, or playing Frisbee.

                        and space when I am introduced to resident pets. I need to get used to other animals slowly and in small steps.
